Summary:
For my final project, create a machine learning system that detects emails that are regarded as spam or phishing. Users can interact with the system by entering the email as a parameter and the program would return whether or not itâ€™s spam. The system will also display its confidence as a percentage of its conclusion.

Technologies:
This project will make of several Python libraries including Numpy to extract data from the dataset, scikit-learn to use linear regression to determine whether or not the input email matches a spam or ham email based on the dataset, and Flask to create a web interface.

Human Interaction:
This project now includes a more user friendly web interface to test spam and ham emails.

How to Run:
This project uses the following libraries:
flask
flask_wtf
WTForms
pandas
scikit-learn
pandas
You can install them with this command:
pip install flask flask_wtf WTForms pandas scikit-learn 

After the packages are installed you can run the app.py file and connect to your local server http://127.0.0.1:5000
